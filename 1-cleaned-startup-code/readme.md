## This is to show how to cleanup a new project

First we create an app using create-react-app<br/>

<ul> 
    <li> Delete all the files inside src
    <li> Just make a new index.js
    <li> Create a default component and dom render it inside root
    <li> Since its a component you need to have first letter capital.
