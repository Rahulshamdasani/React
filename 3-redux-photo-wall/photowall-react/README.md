# React photowall
First we will create the photowall in react and then convert it to redux

## Steps
- Clean the src folder
- Copy my ```index.css```
- Make an app.js which has a useState hook maintaining all the items that are being displayed in the page


## Some important things you should take care of
- Most recent photo should be displayed first
- Two images should be displayed side by side and if there are odd number of images one must take the full size of container


## Once the application is running properly then we can think of converting it to redux so that we dont need to do so much passing of data.
