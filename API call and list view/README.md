S1 : The first step of the assignment is to fetch data from this public JSON API, and present
the information on the screen. The route to fetch the data is:
method: GET
url: https://api.hatchways.io/assessment/students
You do not need any credentials to access the URL above. It should also have CORS set
up, so you should be able to access the data from the browser.
The goal of this part is to present the data on the screen. Do not worry about styling as
you will be doing that in a future step.
